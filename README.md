# MakmurTani: Blockchain-Powered Prosperity for Indonesian Farmers

MakmurTani ("Prosperous Farmer") is a comprehensive platform that brings supply chain transparency and investment opportunities to Indonesia's agricultural sector through the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).

"Tokenizing Prosperity for Indonesia's Farmers"

## The Problem

Indonesia's agricultural sector faces significant challenges related to supply chain inefficiencies and a lack of transparency. 
These issues not only affect farmers' livelihoods but also impact consumers and the overall economy. Key challenges include:

1. **Lack of Transparency**: Farmers often do not know the final price of their products or how much consumers are paying. This opacity can lead to exploitation by middlemen who may take advantage of farmers' lack of market knowledge.

2. **Inefficiencies**: The agricultural supply chain in Indonesia is often fragmented, leading to delays and increased costs. Products may pass through several intermediaries before reaching consumers, each adding their markup.

3. **Fraud and Quality Control**: Counterfeit products and mislabeling can occur, resulting in consumers receiving inferior goods. This not only affects consumer trust but also damages the reputation of genuine producers.

4. **Access to Market Information**: Many smallholder farmers lack access to real-time market data, which hinders their ability to make informed decisions about pricing and sales.

5. **Limited Investment Opportunities**: Farmers often struggle to access capital for expanding their operations or improving their farming techniques.

## Our Solution

MakmurTani utilizes Lisk's blockchain technology to create a decentralized platform that addresses these challenges through:

1. **RWA Tokenization**: Converting agricultural land, crops, and production into tradable digital tokens on the blockchain, enabling fractional ownership and investment.

2. **Supply Chain Transparency**: Tracking agricultural products from farm to table with immutable blockchain records, accessible to all stakeholders.

3. **Smart Contracts for Fair Pricing**: Automating transactions based on predefined conditions, ensuring farmers receive fair compensation.

4. **Real-time Market Data**: Providing farmers with access to current market information to make informed decisions.

5. **DeFi Microloans**: Enabling farmers to access capital by using their tokenized assets as collateral.

## How pharos helps Makmurtani

1. Cost-Effective Transactions for Smallholder Economics
We need that the transaction costs must be minimal (~$0.001) for smallholder economics to be viable:
Efficient Transaction Layer: Pharos's transaction layer is designed for secure and efficient cross-chain asset interactions, keeping costs low even at scale.
Optimized Gas Consumption: The modular architecture enables more efficient processing, critical for making micro-transactions economically viable for rural farmers.

2. Data Layer Benefits for Supply Chain Tracking
MakmurTani's supply chain verification system would benefit from:
Decentralized Data Exchange Protocol: Enables efficient storage and verification of agricultural supply chain data, including IoT sensor readings and verification node attestations.
Support for Advanced Use Cases: The mention of AI and FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) integration suggests Pharos could support MakmurTani's machine learning models for yield prediction and risk assessment.



## Description
MakmurTani is a blockchain-based platform enabling Indonesian smallholder farmers to tokenize agricultural land, crops, and equipment as fractionalized Real-World Assets (RWAs) on Lisk's Ethereum-aligned Layer 2 blockchain.

## What do you do in detail and who do you do it for?
MakmurTani creates a comprehensive ecosystem for Indonesia's 33 million smallholder farmers by:
- Tokenizing agricultural assets (land, crops, equipment) as NFTs and fungible tokens
- Providing DeFi microloans with tokenized assets as collateral at 7-12% APY (vs 18-24% from traditional lenders)
- Enabling transparent supply chain tracking with IoT sensors and blockchain verification
- Operating a marketplace for trading tokenized agricultural assets
- Offering a progressive web app with offline capabilities and bilingual support
- Integrating with IDRX stablecoin for stable, local currency transactions

Our platform serves farmers, investors, financial institutions, supply chain partners, and consumers across Indonesia's agricultural ecosystem.

## What's different about MakmurTani?

MakmurTani uniquely combines:
- Indonesia-specific focus with deep agricultural expertise and local regulatory compliance
- Built on Lisk's L2 for minimal transaction costs (~$0.001) essential for smallholder economics
- Mobile-first, bilingual design optimized for rural areas with unstable connectivity
- Integration with Indonesian rural banking networks and payment systems
- Direct connection to agricultural cooperatives serving as verification nodes
- Comprehensive approach addressing financing, land rights, and market access in one platform

## How do you uniquely solve a problem for your users or customers?
MakmurTani solves three critical problems facing Indonesian agriculture:

1. **Liquidity Gap**: 80% of farmers lack formal loan collateral, creating a $2.8B financing gap. We solve this by tokenizing land and crops as verifiable collateral for DeFi loans.

2. **Middlemen Exploitation**: Farmers typically receive only 30-40% of final crop value due to opaque supply chains. Our blockchain tracking creates transparency from farm to consumer, enabling fair pricing.

3. **Fragmented Land Ownership**: 72% of farmland is informally owned, limiting credit access. Our platform works with both government land registry and community attestations to formalize ownership through NFTs.
