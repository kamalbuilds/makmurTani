## Executive Summary

MakmurTani ("Prosperous Farmer") is a blockchain-based platform enabling Indonesian smallholder farmers to tokenize agricultural land, crops, and equipment as fractionalized Real-World Assets (RWAs) on Lisk's Ethereum-aligned Layer 2 blockchain. By combining DeFi microloans, IoT-enabled crop tracking, and a progressive Next.js web application, we democratize access to liquidity, fair pricing, and global markets for 33 million traditionally unbanked farmers.

Our platform addresses three critical problems:
1. **Liquidity Gap**: 80% of Indonesian farmers lack collateral for formal loans
2. **Middlemen Exploitation**: Farmers typically receive only 30-40% of final crop value
3. **Fragmented Land Ownership**: 72% of farmland is informally owned, limiting credit access

MakmurTani solves these problems through blockchain-based asset tokenization, creating transparent supply chains, and implementing decentralized finance solutions specifically tailored for agricultural applications in Indonesia.

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 The Crisis Facing Indonesian Agriculture

Indonesia's agricultural sector employs approximately 29% of the country's labor force and contributes significantly to its GDP. However, smallholder farmers face systemic challenges that limit their economic potential:

#### 1.1.1 Limited Access to Capital
According to the World Bank (2023), 80% of Indonesian farmers lack the collateral required for formal loans. Financial exclusion restricts their ability to purchase quality seeds, equipment, and fertilizers, resulting in suboptimal yields and perpetuating cycles of poverty.

**Mathematical Representation**:
```
Capital Gap = Σ(Optimal Input Costs - Available Capital)
```

This capital gap exceeds USD $2.8 billion annually across Indonesia's agricultural sector.

#### 1.1.2 Opaque Supply Chains
Multiple layers of intermediaries between farmers and consumers results in farmers receiving only 30-40% of the final retail price of their products (BPS Indonesia, 2022). This economic inefficiency is represented as:

```
Farmer Profit Loss = Market Price - (Production Cost + Middleman Margin)
```

Where Middleman Margin typically equals 50-60% of the final price.

#### 1.1.3 Land Ownership Challenges
72% of agricultural land in Indonesia is managed through informal arrangements or traditional rights (adat), making it difficult for farmers to use land as collateral or make long-term investments. Without formal title, farmers cannot access credit markets or participate in modern financial systems.

### 1.2 Market Analysis
Indonesia's agricultural sector presents a significant opportunity for blockchain-based solutions:

- **33 million farmers** across the archipelago, with 90% classified as smallholders
- **$55 billion** annual agricultural output
- **175 million hectares** of land, with 30% used for agriculture
- **$2.8 billion** estimated agricultural financing gap
- **95.4%** smartphone penetration rate among rural populations (2023)

## 2. Solution Overview

### 2.1 MakmurTani Platform Architecture

MakmurTani creates a comprehensive ecosystem that connects farmers, investors, financial institutions, and consumers through blockchain technology. The platform consists of four primary components:

![sys-architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f5be63-3b8a-42eb-8080-bd1524ffe464)

#### 2.1.1 RWA Tokenization Protocol

Our tokenization protocol converts physical agricultural assets into digital tokens on the Lisk blockchain:

1. **Land Tokenization**: 
   - Farm properties are digitally mapped using GPS and satellite imagery
   - Government-verified land titles or community attestations are recorded
   - Each plot is represented as an ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT)

2. **Crop Tokenization**:
   - Projected harvest yields are tokenized as ERC-20 tokens
   - 1 token = 1 kg of specific crop (e.g., coffee beans, rice)
   - Smart contracts ensure automatic distribution of returns

3. **Equipment Tokenization**:
   - Agricultural equipment represented as fractional NFTs (ERC-1155)
   - Enables community ownership of expensive machinery
   - Smart contracts manage rental, maintenance, and revenue distribution

#### 2.1.2 DeFi Lending Protocol

MakmurTani's DeFi protocol enables farmers to access capital through:

1. **Collateralized Lending**:
   - Farmers stake their tokenized land/crops as collateral
   - Borrow stablecoins (IDRX) at competitive interest rates
   - Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio of 60% for land, 50% for crop tokens

2. **Loan Terms and Repayment**:
   ```
   Repayment Amount = Principal + (Principal × APY_loan × t/365)
   ```
   Where APY_loan = 8% (compared to 18-24% from traditional moneylenders) and t = loan duration in days.

3. **Liquidation Mechanism**:
   - Price oracle monitors collateral value
   - Health Factor = Collateral Value / Loan Value
   - Liquidation triggered if Health Factor < 1.2

#### 2.1.3 Supply Chain Verification System

Our blockchain-based supply chain tracking system:

1. **IoT Integration**:
   - Environmental sensors monitor crop conditions
   - QR codes and RFID tags track physical movement of goods
   - Data is recorded on-chain for immutable record-keeping

2. **Verification Nodes**:
   - Local agricultural cooperatives serve as verification nodes
   - Multi-signature validation of supply chain events
   - Consensus mechanism prevents fraudulent reporting

3. **Consumer Transparency**:
   - End consumers can scan products to view complete provenance
   - Direct farmer-to-consumer communication channel
   - Premium pricing for verified sustainable practices

#### 2.1.4 Marketplace & Exchange

MakmurTani's marketplace allows:

1. **Trading of Tokenized Assets**:
   - Secondary market for land and crop tokens
   - Direct farmer-to-buyer transactions
   - Automated market makers ensure liquidity

2. **Price Discovery Mechanism**:
   - Oracle networks provide real-time price feeds
   - Historical yield data informs pricing models
   - Futures contracts for crop tokens

3. **Cross-Chain Interoperability**:
   - Bridge to Ethereum mainnet and other chains
   - Integration with major DEXs and lending platforms
   - Access to global liquidity pools

## 4. Tokenomics & RWA Mechanics

MakmurTani's economic model is designed to align incentives between farmers, investors, and platform participants while ensuring long-term sustainability.

### 4.1 Token Types & Utility

#### 4.1.1 $MTANI Governance Token

The $MTANI token serves as the governance and utility token for the MakmurTani ecosystem:

- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) tokens
- **Token Distribution**:
  - 40% - Farmers (distributed over 4 years)
  - 30% - Staking rewards and ecosystem growth
  - 20% - Investors and initial liquidity
  - 10% - Team and advisors (vested over 3 years)

**Utility**:
- Governance participation rights
- Fee discounts on marketplace transactions
- Staking rewards from platform revenue
- Access to premium features

#### 4.1.2 RWA-Backed Tokens

Each tokenized real-world asset has specific characteristics:

1. **Land NFTs (ERC-721)**
   - Unique tokens representing specific land parcels
   - Metadata includes geolocation, size, soil quality, and ownership history
   - Can be used as collateral for loans or fractionalized for investment

2. **Crop Tokens (ERC-20)**
   - Fungible tokens representing standardized agricultural outputs
   - 1 token = 1 kg of specific crop (e.g., coffee beans, rice)
   - Backed by real agricultural production

3. **Equipment Tokens (ERC-1155)**
   - Semi-fungible tokens representing shared machinery
   - Governance rights for equipment usage scheduling
   - Revenue sharing from equipment rental

### 4.2 Economic Mechanisms

#### 4.2.1 RWA Valuation Model

Land and crop tokens are valued using a transparent, algorithmic approach:

```
Land NFT Value = (Land Size × Regional Price/ha) + (Crop Yield × 5-Year Avg. Price)
```

Factors influencing valuation include:
- Historical crop yields
- Soil quality metrics
- Water access rights
- Proximity to markets
- Climate risk assessment

#### 4.2.2 Staking Rewards

Stakers earn rewards from platform revenue:

```
APY = (Total Fees Annualized / Total Staked) × 100
```

Fee sources include:
- 0.3% marketplace transaction fee
- 1% loan origination fee
- 0.5% crop token minting fee

#### 4.2.3 Lending Mechanism

Our lending protocol uses a liquidity pool model:
- Loans denominated in IDRX (Indonesian Rupiah stablecoin)
- Interest rates determined algorithmically based on utilization ratio
- Collateralized by tokenized land or crop futures
- Liquidation triggered at 120% collateralization ratio

### 4.3 Token Burn Mechanism

To ensure long-term value accrual, MakmurTani implements a token burn mechanism:
- 10% of all platform fees are used to buy back and burn $MTANI tokens
- Quarterly burns based on platform performance
- Transparent reporting of all burn transactions

### 4.4 Governance Framework

The MakmurTani DAO governs key protocol parameters:
- Interest rate models
- Collateralization ratios
- Fee structures
- Protocol upgrades
- Treasury management

Voting power is determined by:
- $MTANI tokens staked
- Farming activity on platform
- Longevity of participation

// In DeFiLending.sol
// IDRX Contract on Lisk
address constant IDRX_CONTRACT = 0x18Bc5bcC660cf2B9cE3cd51a404aFe1a0cBD3C22;

function provideLoan(uint256 tokenId, uint256 loanAmount) external {
    // Verify collateral
    require(landNFT.ownerOf(tokenId) == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
    
    // Calculate loan parameters based on collateral value
    uint256 collateralValue = getCollateralValue(tokenId);
    require(loanAmount <= (collateralValue * MAX_LTV) / 100, "LTV exceeded");
    
    // Transfer IDRX to borrower
    IERC20(IDRX_CONTRACT).transferFrom(treasury, msg.sender, loanAmount);
    
    // Record loan in the lending pool
    loans[msg.sender][tokenId] = Loan({
        amount: loanAmount,
        startTime: block.timestamp,
        interestRate: calculateInterestRate(),
        collateralId: tokenId
    });
    
    emit LoanIssued(msg.sender, tokenId, loanAmount);
}
```

#### 5.2.2 IDRX Fiat On/Off Ramps

MakmurTani provides multiple methods for farmers and investors to convert between fiat IDR and IDRX:

1. **Direct Bank Integration**:

import { IDRX_CONTRACT_ADDRESS } from '../constants/addresses';

export function useIDRX() {
  const provider = useProvider();
  const { data: signer } = useSigner();
  
  const idrxContract = useContract({
    addressOrName: IDRX_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    contractInterface: IDRX_ABI,
    signerOrProvider: signer || provider,
  });
  
  const getBalance = async (address) => {
    return await idrxContract.balanceOf(address);
  };
  
  const approve = async (spender, amount) => {
    const tx = await idrxContract.approve(spender, amount);
    return await tx.wait();
  };
  
  const transfer = async (recipient, amount) => {
    const tx = await idrxContract.transfer(recipient, amount);
    return await tx.wait();
  };
  
  return {
    getBalance,
    approve,
    transfer,

### 11.2 Economic Models

#### 11.2.1 Valuation Methodology

Detailed formulas for asset valuation:

**Land NFT Valuation**:
```
V_land = Base_land_value + Yield_premium + Location_premium - Risk_factors

Where:
- Base_land_value = Area × Regional_price_per_hectare
- Yield_premium = Historical_yield × Premium_coefficient
- Location_premium = f(Distance_to_market, Infrastructure)
- Risk_factors = Climate_risk + Title_risk + Other_risks
```

**Crop Token Valuation**:
```
V_crop = (Market_price × Expected_yield × Quality_factor) / Total_tokens

Where:
- Quality_factor = f(Organic_certification, Sustainable_practices)
- Expected_yield adjusted by historical performance and weather predictions
```
